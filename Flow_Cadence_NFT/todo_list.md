# TODO: Implement the FlowFees structure to find out how much it costs to do stuff in Flow

# TODO: Automate a .sh script to capture the output from a transaction, grab the required events arguments and calculate the fees from the formula in Flow's documentations

# TODO: Repeat the fee calculations by either subtracting the account balance or using testnet... the damn FlowFees contract Events is not that good
